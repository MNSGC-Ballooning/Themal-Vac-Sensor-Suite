# Thermal-Vac Sensor Suite
Code for the sensor suite that is used with the thermal-vac chamber. 
The sensor suite is used to monitor the inner-conditions of the chamber, including pressure and temperature.
The sensor suite has been upgraded across many iterations to the point where the new sensor suite is on a Teensy 3.5
and includes Honeywell pressure sensors, Adafruit thermocouples, XBee radio communication, relays controlling/powering
fans and heating mesh, the ability to input both commands and external pressure readings, and a predicted alititude
based upon pressure.
